This program contains a visual interface. It is required that the folder
"images" be included at the root of the project folder as well as all the files
that are supposed to be contained within the images folder.

As backup, if the "images" folder or any of its required content is missing,
the program will run by the Java console only.

--------------------------------

**Note about visual program

On a rare occasion, the program will throw the exception,
ConcurrentModificationException. This is a result of the painting of graphics
by the for-each loop in the inherited protected method, paintComponent(), in
the VisualRepresentor class. The for-each loops are needed to paint custom
graphics over the default Java graphics for their components.

The main problem from this arises from the fact that the algorithm for painting
graphics runs in a separate thread. This is Java's implementation of component
drawing and cannot be changed. As the painting thread runs, the main thread may
end up modifying the for-each loop containers concurrently to being accessed by
the painting thread, and from thus, the exception will be thrown.

Due to my limited knowledge of multi-threading and time, I could not fix it by
the time this was submitted.

**As far as I am aware of, the exception does not break the program flow but
  simply causes visual skipping. Please excuse this program error if it occurs.
  If it does cause a full error, either rerun the GUI or remove anything
  related to the images folder and have the program run just by the console.
